The project is a autonomous robot that can detect the specific coloured line painted on a surface of different contrast, in this example it is black line on a white floor. This project is based on Atmega8A microcontroller, the robot can detect the line with CNY70 transoptors. The algorythm controls elecric motors, depending on the voltage on each of three transoptors.
